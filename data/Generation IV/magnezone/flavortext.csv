sword,Some say that Magnezone receives signals from space via the antenna on its head and that it’s being controlled by some mysterious being.
shield,"It’s thought that a special magnetic field changed the molecular structure of this Pokémon’s body, and that’s what caused the Pokémon’s evolution."
legends-arceus,"I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon, changing its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits strange radio waves toward space from its antenna."
