ruby,"MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result, large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this POKéMON."
sapphire,"MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is said that some towns warn people to keep this POKéMON inside a POKé BALL."
emerald,"It is actually three MAGNEMITE linked by magnetism. It generates powerful radio waves that raise temperatures by 3.6 degrees F within a 3,300-foot radius."
firered,A linked cluster formed of several MAGNEMITE. It discharges powerful magnetic waves at high voltage.
