sun,"They send out electrical charges of about 10,000 volts. Because they are high-strung, it can be difficult to grow close to them."
moon,"When its fur stands on end, that’s a sign it’s about to give off a jolt of electricity. Take care, as sometimes lightning strikes next to it, too."
ultra-sun,Its lungs contain an organ that creates electricity. The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales.
ultra-moon,"Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles it fires at enemies. Once they’re weakened, it finishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock."
