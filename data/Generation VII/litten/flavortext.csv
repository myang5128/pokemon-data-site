Game,Flavor Text
sun,"While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery attacks, which change based on how it coughs."
moon,It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen. Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude.
ultra-sun,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no."
ultra-moon,"Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur."
sword,It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.
shield,Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful.
